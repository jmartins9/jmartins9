## ðŸ§  About me

I was born in Ponte de Lima, Portugal, and have always been passionate about technology and innovation.

With a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Minho, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering at the same institution, specializing in Intelligent Systems and Applications Engineering.

As a **backend engineer**, I enjoy designing robust and scalable systems, exploring distributed architectures, event-driven communication, and cloud-native environments. I am driven by curiosity and a constant desire to improve, taking on challenges that push me to learn and grow.

## ðŸ’¼ Experience

### Checkmarx â€“ Internship
**Role:** Software Engineering Intern  
**Focus:** Language processing and grammar-based analysis  

During my internship at Checkmarx, I worked on **processing programming languages using grammars**, helping to build tools that parse and analyze code for security and quality checks. I utilized **ANTLR** for grammar definitions and **.NET** for implementation, gaining hands-on experience in compiler-like tooling and language processing workflows. This experience strengthened my understanding of **parsing, syntax trees, and automated code analysis**.

### Critical TechWorks â€“ Internship (Current)
**Role:** Backend Engineering Intern  
**Focus:** Event-driven systems, cloud infrastructure, and microservices  

At Critical TechWorks, I am currently working with **Kafka** for event-driven architectures, **AWS** for cloud-native solutions, **Java (Quarkus)** for microservices development, and **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
