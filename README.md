**About me**

I was born in Ponte de Lima, Portugal and I've always been passionate about technology and innovation. 

Holding a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Minho, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering at the same institution, specializing in Intelligent Systems and Applications Engineering.

As a dedicated individual, I am motivated by a constant desire to learn new things and challenge myself. 

Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have gained knowledge in several programming languages and technologies, including C, C#, Java and Python. 

I am always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my skills and make meaningful contributions to projects that inspire innovation and creativity.
